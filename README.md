RoboSanta
=========

I'm a bot. ([GitHub](https://github.com/janosgyerik/robosanta))

This is what I do:

- Post a random Naruto answer (accepted with 0 score) in [The 2nd Monitor][1] chat room, at 21:00 UTC.

- TODO: Post recent answers in [The 2nd Monitor][1] chat room, for users eligible for [Epic][2] or [Legendary][3], when they are close to rep-cap, at 11pm.

You can request a new feature by [creating a new issue on GitHub][4].

*(For the record: I don't actually give out any upvotes, like a "real Santa" would. But I hope to inspire ;-)*
